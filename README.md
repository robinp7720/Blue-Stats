# BlueStats is no longer maintained
If you wish to take over the project, I will gladly link your fork here. I would hate for this project to die. Simply drop me an email! I don't bite.
**I will not be answering any questions or provide any help regarding the setup of this web application**

I want the thank the minecraft community for providing a lot of support for the project. Especially to lolmewm for providing the original stats plugin which started the entire project and for his general support of the project.

However, due to a combination of leaving the minecraft community and others demanding support for a project that I developed for myself and graciously provided to the greater community under an open license, BlueStats will **not** be recieving any updates from myself.

No error, no help. Please, if you want help, you must give me your error log. Else I will simply dismiss your issue.

# Blue-Stats-Minecraft
BlueStats is not your standard minecraft statistics panel. It is not made to support a single plugin, instead it is designed to support all of them. Through the use of plugins, BlueStats can be thought how to read the database layouts of bukkit/spigot plugins. Not only is it designed to display server statistics, it is designed to replace your server homepage to have a dynamically updating site with user statistics built right in!

BlueStats is expandable through the use of plugins and themes to suit your minecraft brand. While the included themes work out of the box, you are encouraged to create your own to advertise your server.

A live demo can be found here: https://stats.mysunland.org
